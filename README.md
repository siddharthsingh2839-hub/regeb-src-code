## 🔧 Improvements Over Original Argon Client

**ORIGINAL PROJECT**

https://github.com/LvStrnggg/argon/


This fork is approximately **75% based on the original Argon**, but with focused optimizations for **bypassing Vulcan** and reducing flagging on **Grim Anticheat**. It's a graphics and anticheat-optimized version of Argon with the following key changes:

- **Legit Autototem (HoverTotem-Like)**
  - Introduced **dynamic delay** to simulate human-like behavior
  - removed autoswitch due to unstable bypasses from argon

- **Dhandmod integration**
  - basically autoswitch subfunction from hovertotem of argon but without padpackets and impossibleslot action and impossible human time
  - does not flag on any anticheat - for now
  - can choose your totem slot
  - can customize automation timings

- **Misclick Optimizer**
  - Rewritten and extended from Argon's original
  - Prevents **packet order B flags** (Grim)
  - Reduces **Multiactions F flagging**
  - Best paired with **AutoCrystal** and **Anchor Macro**

- **KeyPearl Enhancements**
  - Added **switchback slot selection** for faster **double-tapping** and **pearl flashing**
  - Eliminates **packet order B flagging** from original

- **Placement Optimizer**
  - Allows faster crystal placement pair with autocrystal, removing 2 tick placement delay - bypasses vulcan and grim
  - allows quick block up useful for cpvp
  - Now includes **anchor exclusion** to improve legit like gameplay with Anchor Macro

- **Target HUD Improvements**
  - Sleeker and cleaner design
  - Displays **extra opponent information** for PvP clarity

- **Camera Optimizer**
  - Improved camera control for better PvP experience such as no clip and water+ lava visual optimizers
  - Designed to work well with **Freelook mod**

- **And alot more tiny adjustments**
> ⚠️ Note: This is not a full rewrite — it's still fundamentally Argon, but with meaningful tweaks to **bypass**, **optimize**, and **refine** both visuals and behavior for smoother gameplay under grim anticheat and vulcan.





## How to use System

1. Download the latest version of system (Jar file only)
2. If you haven't already knew, you are required to download fabric api jar to be run alongside system, and use fabric loader for 1.21.1 or 1.21 to launch system. there are youtube tutorials for this
3. move the system jar into your minecraft mods folder.
4. launch minecraft using fabric loader 1.21.1 or 1.21
5. build a suitable configuration for the servers you are targeting to bypass - keep reading read.me for config guide
6. Enjoy System!

> if an issue still coccurs, please send your crash log "latest.log" in my discord server for troubleshooting.

## Configs

**Grim AC** - PvpHub, Donut SMP, and likely any other large Popular servers.

DON'T USE
- Autototem-blatant
- Autocrystal to lower than 2 ticks for both break and place
- Anchor Macro set to super fast - 0 ticks - test on loyisa.cn anticheat test server
- break optimizer
- jump optimizer
- totem offhand

**Bypassable when done correctly. if you are bad at crystal pvp in the first place avoid using these modules**

- Dtapsetup
- anchor spam along with airplacement with anchor macro and airplace optimizer


*YOU MUST*
- auto xp not 0 delay
- misclick optimizer MUST BE ENABLED WITH ALL SUBFUNCTIONS
- placement optimizer MUST EXCLUDE ANCHORS
- Use common sense, most 0 delays flag. Please check using a Anticheat server - eu.loyisa.cn

**Vulcan and other insignificant anticheats** - Eupvp.net, mcprac.net, mcpvp.club, Pvp Legacy, Stray.gg

Most modules bypasses. If you want safety, then:

*Use the same config for Grim AC BUT*

- you can use anchor macro safe and quickly using the DEFAULT settings.
- you can use Dig optimizer  - not recommended but usable
- you can use jump optimizer - not recommended but usable
- you can use dtapsetup

**This is only a guide/general idea. For your own safety, i HIGHLY recommend you test your configs on a anticheat test server. BEFORE playing any of your favourite servers.**
